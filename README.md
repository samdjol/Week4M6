# Prompt Engineering for Data Analysis 

This repository explores the use of prompt engineering with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and solve common data analysis problems. The included Python notebook serves as a practical example of how to craft effective prompts to generate functional, high-quality Python code for data processing, calculation, and visualization.

## About This Project

Instead of writing data analysis code from scratch, this project demonstrates a "prompt-first" approach. By providing a detailed, well-structured natural language prompt to an LLM, we can generate the necessary Python code to perform complex tasks. This allows analysts and data scientists to focus more on defining the problem and interpreting results, rather than on boilerplate coding.

The core of this repository is a single notebook that tackles a realistic inventory analysis scenario.
